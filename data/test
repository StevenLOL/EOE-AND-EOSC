After O

I O
decided O
to O
give O
it O
a O
try O
with O
two O
friends O

<end_for_sentence>
First O
of O
all O
, O
this O
place B 0
is O
not O
romantic O

claimed O
by O

editorial O
review O

<end_for_sentence>
If O
that O
's O
a O
problem O
, O
go O
to O
McDonald O

and O
destroy O
your O
insides O
. O
<end_for_sentence>
An O
excellent O
alternative O
to O
fast B 0
food I
joints O
and O
ordering O
in O
but O
, O
the O
food B 0
was O
slightly O
disappointing O
. O
<end_for_sentence>
Over O
time O
, O
the O
food B 0
quality I
has O
decreased O
substantially O
, O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
less O
crowded O
than O
it O
used O
to O
, O
and O
the O
service B 0
must O
definitely O
be O
part O
of O
the O
reason O

<end_for_sentence>
For O
those O
that O
go O
once O
and O
do O
n't O

all O
I O
can O
say O
is O
that O
they O
just O
do O
n't O
get O
it O
. O
<end_for_sentence>
Usually O
3 O
vs. O
4 O
