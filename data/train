All O
I O

WOW O

<end_for_sentence>
though O
the O
service B 3
could O
be O
better O
-LRB- O
possibly O
due O
to O
more O
than O
one O
very O
large O
group O
in O
the O

, O
it O
is O
very O
cordial O

<end_for_sentence>
The O
decor B 1
in O
this O

very O
diner-ish O
and O
the O
kind O
of O
place B 1
you O
expect O
in O
the O
East O
Village O
- O
not O
romantic O
, O
just O
simple O

<end_for_sentence>
This O
is O
a O
cute O
place B 1

they O
need O

I O
have O
never O
